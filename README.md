# About the Repository:
## This repository is for CP1404 (Programming 2), which contains files for the practicals done in this subject

# About me:
## I grew up in a small community but moved after 5 years out of high school, figuring out where I wanted to work in the world

# Three things learnt about "Clean Code":
## 1. Don't repeat yourself (DRY); if you use something in multiple places, make it a constant or a function
## 2. Comments are a good addition to provide insight for outside viewers observing written code
## 3. Single Responsibility Purpose (SRP); a function should be responsible for only one thing
